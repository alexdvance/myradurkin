        <p>My practice welcomes individuals and couples who want a safe, comfortable and open place to learn more about their concerns and, even more important, their strengths and abilities in their relationships and their lives.  Whether they are or arenâ€™t familiar with mind/body approaches such as self-hypnosis combined with psychotherapy, I collaborate with them so they can choose what works best for them instead of having a treatment or technique selected for them.</p>
 
        <p>I have learned the great efficacy of the mind/body approaches I use from seeing many people who have been in long therapies but have not been able to change how they feel, think and live their lives.  The approaches I use nearly always galvanize their treatment and enable profound and lasting changes to take place, often in six to eight weeks.</p>
         
        <p>I welcome questions and concerns before as well as during treatment.</p>
        
        <h3>Payment</h3>
         
        <p>I ask for payment to be made at each session by either check or cash.  If there is financial hardship, please discuss this with me to determine whether you may have a reduced fee.</p>
         
        <p>I have chosen to practice outside of the managed care networks in order to insure confidentiality, provide the flexibility of choosing the therapist of your choice, and reduce insurance-based costs.  I will give you a receipt to send to your insurance for out-of-network benefits.  You are responsible for knowing your insurance coverage.</p>

        <p>In my practice I welcome individuals and couples who want a safe, comfortable and open place to learn more about their concerns about their relationships and their lives, and to focus on their strengths and abilities. When my clients come to me, some are already familiar with mind/body approaches (e.g. self-hypnosis combined with psychotherapy), and some aren’t. In all cases, I like to collaborate with them, so they can choose the approaches they feel will work best for them.</p>

        <p>Often my clients have participated in long psychotherapies without being able to change how they feel, think and live their lives. My approach enables them to finally realize profound and lasting changes, many in six to eight weeks.</p>

        <p>I welcome questions and concerns before as well as during treatment.</p>

        <h3>Payment</h3>

        <p>I ask for payment to be made at each session by check or cash. If there is financial hardship, please feel free to discuss with me possible eligibility for a reduced fee.</p>

        <p>I have chosen to practice outside of the managed care networks to ensure my clients’ confidentiality, their right to the therapist of their choice, and to reduce insurance-based costs. I can provide receipts to be sent to insurance companies for out-of-network benefits, but my clients must take responsibility for knowing their own insurance coverage.</p>
